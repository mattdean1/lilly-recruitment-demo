# nodejs-bootcamp-demo

I learned Node, Express, and Handlebars over 2-3 days whilst making [a demo app](https://github.com/mattdean1/quake-supply), then went on to run a Node.js bootcamp (a 90 minute webinar) and mentor student developers through the recruitment process.

This repo holds the code I created during the webinar, and showcases the basics of Node.js and the Express framework.
